0,"Terrible customer Service 🤬, not a good experience in the branch either and the people who work there.I opened an All inclusive account and applied for a credit card which took them almost 1.5 months to dispatch from the date of approval 🙄.When I called the branch person, said its problem with Credit card team & delays from Canada post. But when I call the credit card department they said its problem with the branch who did not submitted my application and holded for atleast a month from the date of approval. I don’t know whom to blame here and even they do not have a good process to provide complaints like these so that they can work on fixing them. Probably they don’t want to improve there customer experience 😜I am closing all my accounts with TD and recommend others to think alot before opening one. GOOD LUCK !!"
1,"Don't bank with them, worst bank ever who don't treat their customers right during difficult times like these. Been almost 20 years with them but they don't value me for a mere $29.95 fees mistake that is clearly unintended. Already closed one account and as soon I find another bank, I am moving as soon as possible."
2,"On May 21 2020 I deposited $700 (new $20 bills) into the ATM inside on the left. The machine gave me a $280.00 deposit slip printout. I went inside to have a manager look into this as I was crying and upset. I have been with them for 3 years. The teller deposited $420 into my account. I had a portion to pay of my overdraft. I was told they would open an investigation. May 25 2020 $420 was withdrawn from my account. I went in and spoke to them and they said my claim was denied. I asked for a sit down with the management and did not get that. Please do not load new bills into their ATM machine! I have not received any emails, calls or anything from them. I did get a email from the TD obudsman asking me to sign papers so they investigate my claim and I am to accept their final decision. I am on disability and $300 was from the extra money from the government for people on disability. It was taken from me. I contacted the MLA, financial services, TD Bank fraud department (supposed claim that does not exist), news, complaint department, etc. No one will listen Where is video of me putting money in? Where is the $420 that exceeded the ATM machine funds for May 21 2020. Even if you need service, do not use their atm, watch your bank statements and consider changing banks please. Update: they closed my claim and I was basically called a lier"
3,"WORST BANK EVER.  DON'T EVER BANK WITH THEM.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, CHARGES FOR EVERYTHING. CROOKS"
4,"They used to be great for students like me before COVID-19 although I had noticed some issues like them hiking up balance protection tax to 6$ a month (unacceptable given you're covered by visa). They used to be quite convenient. The COVID-19 saw them reduce hours, be unreachable by phone. I went to buy a used car from a garage and was on the phone for 45min with no answer to up my limit; I had to call a family member to pay and it took me 2days of e-transfers to pay them back. I recently tried to buy something online and got a hold placed (but the bank didn't inform me) and since you can't reach them by phone, you have to go to a branch. They're no longer reliable, I can't seem to make purchases above 150$ without them blocking me by placing holds (this isn't regularly the case but twice in the summer and 3 times in a year is a bit much. Also, the people answering the phone for ""loss and prevention"" can be rude and impatient; it takes me 2 min to open up easy access and I said I'm sorry for being slow, don't rush me :/. Worst part is they answered the phone immediately when they saw they could make a quick 500$ on car insurance (I didn't go with them). This shows that customer service for your daily banking isn't the priority, sales are.I'll end this on a positive note: the teller's are often quite nice. (This review is more geared towards TD values and it's corporate priorities/decrease in quality.)"
5,"I’ve been trying to reach agents for 5 days and I still can’t get a hold of someone at TD. When I do get a hold of someone, they transfer me from one person to another and each one knows less then the other. They automatically stopped my payments towards a loan I have with them and they’re taking no responsibility for what they did, they’re arrogant and Self righteous, I suppose TD’s core values are treat every customer as if they’re insignificant and terrible. All I want to do is pay off my loan and these people have made it into the most hideous experience imaginable. Don’t ever go with this bank because they will drag your credit score In the mud even though you’ve always paid off multiple loans on time and in complete. The worst bank and worst core value and very aggressive agents who have the my way or the high way attitude. Just save yourself the trouble and go with a different bank."
6,"I called TD insurance regarding an emergency matter, I waited for 1hr12min and no one answered. I don't know what to say but I know that I will cancel my insurance policy with them.* I have proof of that"
7,Due to Corona they close all branches in my city . 4 months goes by before they even allow access to my money . They then flag my account for doing to much business in a month . Ruined my credit with visa . Closed my account . Td Canada trust are crooked as they come if they can’t make enough money off you they’ll close your account for no reason . Hope they’re ready for lawsuit .
8,I will say have been a customer since Canada Trust was its own bank but have noticed in the last year TD Canada Trust don't care about there customers only about them selfs they do anything to get money out of you charges here charges there will say TD Canada Trust Sucks
9,The worst custumer service I had!!Their validations rules are ridiculous. You have to have open your online banking to answer their questions!! and even worse they says that the answers are incorrect and block your account!!!Is very difficult to use their debits cards outside US
10,"Upon moving to Vancouver from Ontario to enter long term care for her Alzheimer's, my 86 year old Mom's banking was mostly with TD, some with BMO. We made an appointment with TD to change her address and we attended in person (which is not an easy thing to do). Unfortunately most of her ID was expired (passport, drivers license) but her Ontario Healthcare picture ID was valid. She also had a banking card and PIN, a birth certificate, SIN, and her signature was on file. Despite all of this and us standing right in front of them they wouldn't update her address. So I closed everything and moved it to BMO who welcomed us with open arms. TD Canada Trust are ridiculously bad!"
11,"Giving TD bank a one star is generous - i would give them no starts if i could. They have absolutely NO customer service, cumbersome online and phone processes that make accessing help almost completely impossible, and there is absolutely NOTHING to recommend them. I have a new credit card with them that I am trying to pay and i cant even access my account to pay it. Hey TD - do you want me to pay my bill or not? Once I get this bill paid - when i can actually get my bill - i will be done. I would recommend NEVER banking with them. I know all banks can be problematic but honestly interacting with TD's online/telephone/web   is the worst i have had the mis-pleasure to work with."
12,"it is worst and sucking bank , do not trust the sucking one"
13,TD maintains a poor cloud platform. I opened two TFSAs for myself and my wife linked to direct trading. The website is down on a daily basis.Very frustrating! Their customer service keeps apologising but nothing changes. Later I asked to add option trading to the accounts. It has taken more than a week to enable this all the time I cannot trade! if you want to invest there are lots of other platforms.
14,"I sold my house which TD carried the mortgage.  After taking multiple fees to sell it, 1 month later it wasnt discharged because the fees were done incorrectly.  I'm now scrambling to get the discharge over a month later.  This is difficult since I'm no longer in the country and they require me to come to a branch to take care of it.  They also withheld closing out accounts following a family death much longer than appropriate.  I will NEVER do business with them again."
15,If there would be a chance to put a zero star .. i would love to do that.. they dont know how to talk with customer .. 0 knowledge about the service.. all the time start detucting money from my account
16,"I can't even with this bank.... Had been trying to get shares deposited for over 3 months, get shares deposited and now I can't transfer the money out and can't open a bank account. I have never seen a company work so hard to avoid new customers. The take ZERO responsibility and dealing with customer service has been the worst experience. Avoid this bank like the plague unless you are a sadist and want to feel pain"
17,"I agree with all your reviews they are terrible, I was with them 20 years and I have excellent credit until I was defrauded just this year.. I had to appeal 3 times and told them many times this is an employment scam fraud...This monster took my visa maxed it out and took my TFSA and line of credit.. If they cant stop a fraudulent transaction on visa going to another country than thats a terrible bank and a huge loss.. They also ruined/trashed my credit by saying I gave away my pin.. Dont ever bank with TD CANADA TRUST never..If they tell you contact the ombudsman they will only say we cannot intervene..They wont give you back stolen funds that belong to you,they will accuse you and let FRAUDSTERS get away.."
18,"Does not matter what type of service you are talking, TD sucks in its customer service. Extremely Long wait times and very non professional attitude...I am TD customer for almost 20 years and rarely used their services but now I think enough is enough..."
19,"Their customer service sucks complete ass. Online service included. Would not recommend in the slightest, it's a waste of your time."
20,Absolute worst...and they NEVER take responsibilities.  No wonder they are facing class action lawsuits. Stay away from them!
21,"I would give TD 0 stars if I could. I’ve been banking with TD since I was a kid and it’s been nothing but issues and the worst customer service. I had my bank card stolen, and didn’t have money transferred back into my account a couple weeks later for a bill. Incurred an NSF they refused to remove. Funny how were in a pandemic and can barely make ends meet and TD is still making earnings on these ridiculous 48$ NSF fees. Now I’m 20$ short for paying my bill at all. Robbery. Way to kick someone while they’re down. Way to go TD. Thankfully opened up an account at BMO. Way better customer service there"
22,"Where to start been banking with TD for over 20 years mortage line of credit with them and I've been loyal. In 2018 forced to file bankruptcy due to non invoice payment by a big GC in calgary, Now with Covid and deferals asked to have my mortage extended from 21 years to 30 to reduce the payment and guess what NO TD have treated my like a leper with a doce of VD and some HEP C thrown in TD is a blood sucker that takes everything when times are good and never helps when times are bad I hope they go bust to"
23,Sad to see a bank treat people that fall on hard times badly been making small payments monthly and they have filed a false information about my payments to the credit bureau they also took and oldPay check from a company and failed to return it till it was pointed out to them took them 6 months I wouldNot recommended this bank to anyone I was a customer for 10 years
24,"I have been with TD for 8 years and have run into a variety of issues with the bank. The issues that I have dealt with primarily come from the technical side. TD Two-step authentication is a flawed system, if you change your number and forget to switch the authentication while the old number is not active, you will promptly be unable to pay for government issued documents. As CRA and GOVT websites requires easyweb two-step authentication. TD banking machines have eaten my card and failed to return it to me. The rates are mediocre and they fail to try to keep you as a banker.TD is a total disaster."
25,"Thoroughly disgusted by how this bank treats their customers. I have received many threatening letters regarding something where I am completely compliant. I call and complain but nothing changes. Out of mere convenience, I have stayed but if this continues, I will switch immediately."
26,"Terrible bank, poor customer service, lack of communication, unprofessional Rude incompetent staff. Low quality bank"
27,They retain your checks even if they are the same customers after months
28,Worst service at 500 country hills Blvd in Calgary they think all there customers are crooks even if they have been there for 30 plus years and never had any problems with there account. May be that’s the kind of customer they deserve.
29,"I have overlimte fees on my visa card. I went to the branch to fix the problem and they told me we can't, the visa transactions or problem solved by phone. I called them by phone and they told me go to the branch again to solve the problem . Nothing to do"
30,This Bank is horrible when it comes to flexibility with your own money !! Zero flexibility during pandemic time !!!Can only wave the NSF Fee once and can’t doing a second time even if the funds were transferred right away ! Ive asked many times to have the overdrafts on my account but somehow was never done  ! I’ve moved my RRSPs to another investment and looking to do the same with my TFSA first thing tomorrow and shopping for a new bank ! TD you have a bad costumer service and not reliable with our money !!!
31,"TD closed the branch near me without any attempt to gain more customers even though the bank always seemed to have customers waiting in a short line. This branch closed and now the nearest branch is 10 minutes farther away and due to having to do the job of 2 stores they can't keep up, it now takes 15 minutes to get to the drive in machine and 4 minutes to do a transaction that used to take 30 seconds, all the while looking at a sign that says America's most convenient bank. I have about $1M in the bank-how do they treat people with less?"
32,"Hello, I am Mohammed Hamdan. Yaar Muhammad Khan was my lawyer and I need to warn you about this man.  HIS MAN IS A CON ARTIST, A SCAMMER, A CHEATER, A LIAR. HE ACTS LIKE HE WILL PAY YOU BACK BUT HE ENDS UP STEALING YOUR MONEY. HE ACTS LIKE HES A FAITHFUL HONEST MUSLIM AND USES ISLAM AS AN EXCUSE BUT HE WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY. DON’T BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD THIS MAN SAYS, BEWARE.I sent him a check and  The check had been refused by freight liner dealer at Hamilton Ontario Canada and I spoke to Mike west (manager) and he didnt care and didnt help me at all and mentioned it wasnt any of his business."
33,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK. Nothing but headaches. Every time. Guaranteed. I'll not tell all my stories as I would be here for days. Today's incident.... went to TD ATM to deposit an eCheck. ATM could not recognize the check (printed clearly, cut perfectly etc.) Went home, downloaded the app to deposit by photo, can not deposit more than $5k by the app. And, I suppose, there will be another screw up when I now go into the bank and see a teller. Nothing but troubles at TD Bank."
34,"This institution has the absolute worste customer support, I purchased a Samsung note 10 and received no interest loan. I ended up paying it off in 5 months instead of 24 months. I just got tired of TD bank and their CS. I set up auto pay and the payment didn't go through on time so I called and was told it taked 2 months to process. Then I changed my payment bank account and they said well have to wait another 2 months. This is after waiting on the phone for an hour each occerance. Saisis a leading tech company and they can't find an intelligent bank to handle their business? Beware of this lackluster Bank!"
35,Was with TD for years until I realized there are better options - any other bank. When Canada Trust and TD merged my money manager told me TD had merged with CT because CT was taking customers from the big 5 due to their customer service and TD wanted that attitude to be adopted by TD employees. That may have been the intention but if it was a success it lasted a short time and TD has become the worst of the big 5 again. Sad!!!
36,"TD bank is a nightmare! I had the worst experience. The customer service is horrible. The employees are literally yelling and insulting the customers. The personal banker even suggest one of the customer to go get some respect at Chase Bank. TD is not bad everywhere. It also depends on the location. The Valley Stream location which I used to visit before had super nice employees. But, after visiting their location in Kew Gardens I want to close my account. They are not at all cooperative. Please stay away from them!"
37,"Avoid this bank at all cost. They're not open to any mortgage rate negotiations. They have the longest wait time for auto insurance quotes. The phone automation service is outdated... doesn't even tell you your wait time lol. Lastly, they don't follow up with your needs, but only their marketing material. TD is in it for your money, not for you. Period!"
38,They will hold your money hostage. Make every step of your banking as difficult as possible. I have good credit but won't even give 300 dollar overdraft protection on my chequing account but have no problem taking The NSF fee. Got an account at Scotiabank with 1000 overdraft no problem. Worst bank ever. Wish I could give 0 stars
39,"You guys are absolutely horrible, you don’t let people inside the bank to reset a pin but then you call like they tell you have to and you can’t do it either. Your withholding my own money from me! Because of this I will be closing my account tomorrow and done with you people. Your hours are horrible and customer service sucks! Thanks!"
40,"This is worst bank when it comes to dealing with their customers. First, they insult the customers by putting them on hold. It happens every time I called them. Second, their employees are very rude and try to dictate whatever they want. They think the customers are ignorant and stupid."
41,"You actually get no stars. A big fat zero. I cannot begin to fathom how you operate a Web Broker trading platform that is down due to technical issues the last hour of trade on a Friday afternoon, potentially costing me thousands of dollars.  I may be speaking to my lawyer Monday morning if your ineptness has cost me any money from the time it went down to market close.  Time to find a reliable platform!"
42,Horrible customer service! You can hang on the line for ever! Almost impossible to get help.
43,"Recently called TD dispute line, Representative DAVID was extremely rude, dismissive and not at all patient with me. I was trying to speak with him politely and he was extremely rude and disrespectful, spoke to me like I was stupid and hung up on my face... A CUSTOMER.Very disappointing"
44,This bank is generally good when going to the bank in person. But when calling customer service I asked to speak to a manager to cancle a credit card payment that charged me twice. The managers name was Sarah she was absolutely awful!! and in no way should be working customer service she was rude and cross in her tone. And absolutely did nothing to help my situation. There is a way of speaking to people and this woman did not know how to be polite in anyway.
45,"Very misleading!!!I just came back from the branch where I was sent to activate my credit card. They took our ID (primary & secondary card holder). They confirmed all is done at their end, they told us to go home and make a phone call to activate the cards. We insisted and told them we were advised they are the ones to do it.We just called online and the agent said it has to be done at the branch, he said he has no access to our profiles.Again we insisted to look into it further, that we were advised they are the ones to do it. He put us on hold and then hung up.I have to add that this was my 4th trip to a TD Branch for the same issue."
46,"This bank is the worst the customer  service  representatives  are nasty..and rude...they tell u all these offers til u sign up for a account  and things are different  they don't  give u overdraft  when your enrolled in advance or standard..they aren't  interested  in what the customers  need or inconvenience...to customers  the Atlantic  City  bank have disabled people  out in the sun to get services  unlike other banks..in the drive through  line..this bank is the worst bank the secure messenging system takes several  weeks too respond..during  the pandemic  all other  banks are open to customers  ..the customers service are attitudish and act as if there doing us a favor by letting  you bank with them...do not use this bank..avoid them.by all means..I also have pictures to post of the customers  standing outside  in the sun ..people in wheelchairs to cash checks there horrible..and don't  sign up with them they are not giving  new customers  the benefits there offering overdraft..advance  etc..after  90 days..they don't  tell u that in the beginning  when applying for a account..its a total inconvenience and its embarrassing  to expect certain services  than this..Leave this bank alone and they Diffently  need better customers  service representatives  there nasty,sarcastic  and straight  rude!!!!"
47,"I paid my balance in full two days ahead of the due date and still faced a late fee penalty for using their app. Multiple times I did what the customer service people said to do to avoid a late fee and I still got one. And I always payed my bill in full days ahead of time. But for some reason it always posted a day late, incurring me with a $35 fee. The money was taken out of my TD bank account and for three days there was no record of it. Just gone. Until it showed up a day late on my credit card bill. And this was multiple times. Then you call their customer service people who are just as stupid as the company they work for, and they act like you’re a moron for using their app. When the TD card services representatives don’t know anything about the transaction. How can you take hundreds of dollars out of my bank account and then there’s no record of it, even for the horrible customer service people who work for the bank that took my money. Worst credit card ever, hands down."
48,"Their phone time wait for anything was never great; now in Covid times, it's absolutely disgusting. You're likely to wait 30 minutes then get cut off. If you get through, it's only after 50 or more minutes. Then there's the bank reps - you get them working on something and they just drop it. If it wasn't going to be a PITA to change everything, I'd go elsewhere. In the meantime, I do all my banking online so I don't have to bother with any of their personnel."
49,Terrible phone in customer service I can never get threw on the phone when I did I was on hold for over an hour! there fees are over the top 48$ for a nsf.
50,"If I could rate TD Bank below a negative zero, I would passionately do it!! First and foremost, I am a target card holder. I have had an impeccable payment history. Not once being late and in fact, I am always early and Make payments triple the amount due monthly. I learned that TD Bank has decided to lower my credit limit significantly due to the increase balances on my credit report. Let me point out what these banks like TD Bank are Notorious for doing. If you don’t use enough of your line of credit they either reduce it or close your account. When they can increase your line of credit without asking for it. In this particular case, I have use several of my other credit cards for medical purposes yes, Covid related like my MasterCard or American Express therefore, my over balance on my credit report will reflect this. So what does TD Bank do, lowers my line of credit significantly. I have NEVER EVER brought my credit utilization over 30%. Well guess what? TD Bank is ruining my credit score that I worked hard to improve. Now it appears as if I used 99.9% on my credit limit because they reduce the limit to what I currently owe!!!! These banks are not here to help people, they are only concern of what their portfolios look like! Once I pay this balance off, I will never use this card again!! Both my daughters also have target credit cards and they will no longer be shopping at target. Horrible business practice!! I could understand if I was defaulted on my account or late in payments. No I am the complete opposite! I spend an insane amount of money and pay my balances off in a short time to avoid paying interest. I am making everyone aware of these business practices. TD Bank will approve you for a credit card, shortly after, increase your credit limit significantly (without your knowledge) and when the time comes for them to improve their profits, they reduce your credit line severely impacting your credit utilization and credit score! Do Not get sucked into opening an account with TD Bank, you will get SCREWED! Go to your credit union, Citibank or American Express. These are the companies that actually care for people and I mean truly care for people!! TD Bank and Synchrony WILL ruin your credit and I mean ruin your credit you worked so hard to improve!!!"
51,"TD is not a good bank that I would recommend to someone my friend or family member. They have the worst customer service. They behave unprofessionally. They even don’t know how to deal with customer. The worst bank I have ever had. You just go for 5 min work to do. However, they make it 1H or even longer than that."
52,This bank is the worst!! They purposely hold back your money so they can charge you with an overdraft payment. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this bank
53,My credit rating was damaged when TD didn't notify me of a remaining balance after I cancelled my card.  Six months later I became aware and rectified it.  TD did send a request to Equifax to resolve the credit drop but it hasn't yet taken effect (credit rating is still well below where it should be)My experience with all other banks is that a balance must be paid in full (not merely a promise to repay) before one can close an account and this is how it should be.
54,i have to reset my password about 70% of the time and about 20% of that i have to call TD bank and spend 20-30 min on the phone just to access my account. They ask questions that can only be answered while looking at your account. It's ridiculous! My boyfriend also has an account and he can't make e-transfer work from his account work. If other banks offered e-series i would transfer.
55,"I have just spoke to a super rude and unprofessional person at the calling center. What a rude and a racist person. Cutting me off, talking to me like if he is my boss who is giving me a favor.   then at the end he is asking me if i need someone who can speak Hindi, Punjabi !!!!!! I told him that we are speaking English right now, I do not need a translator. and by the way I do not speak Hindi or Punjabi, Plus why would he bring this unnecessary comment? Oh he is assuming that I am Hindi or Punjabi ? and that was the reason for being rude?. I think you TD bank should hire some professionals who have manners."
56,What a joke of a bank. Why do $100 e-transfers take over an hour to send? Absolutely disgusting service.
57,Worst bank ever. No one knows what they are doing. You just get transferred from phone to branch to phone and more people on the phone
58,"Last Friday August 7, 2020 I went to the Paris  ON Branch, with my fiance. The girl that they have outside of the bank who finds out the reason for your visit is very rude and unprofessional. She should stop racially profiling me whenever I come there to the branch. When you treat others differently and give bad treatment to people you seem to deem as beneath you, you shouldn't be working with the public. The next time you try to treat me in that manner, I will file a human rights complaint against you and TD Canada Trust bank. Racists like the lady you have working out in front of the bank are disgusting. Her behaviour is gross, period. The worst thing about the whole ordeal was that she thinks that she was being sneaky with her covert racist behaviour, but people  like myself know exactly what type of racist game you're playing. I hope that one day someone treats you the exact way that you treated me, when the only thing that I had to do to you was show up at the bank to do my banking. You would think that this lady being of East Indian descent would understand what racism is and act better than that. But in this case certainly not."
59,"I wouldn't do any banking with TD.  I have been with them for over 8 years and I can tell you time after time their checking accounts minimum balance to avoid fees keeps going up.  This year they decided that even $6,000 for my minimum checking account wasn't enough to avoid a $3.95 fee a month.  Now hold on a second TD. You telling me you don't make $3.95 in interest from lending my $6,000 each month?  The greed this bank has is beyond belief.  Guess what? I'm transfering my money to questrade for my TFSA.  Questrade has lower fees to buy stocks.  So TD your greed for the $3.95 is not only going to mean less of my money in your useless checking account but also I'm transfering my TFSA to questrade so you won't make $10 on me everytime I buy or sell stocks.  Now who is the loser in this equation? Keep your $3.95 and enjoy it while it lasts."
60,"Worst customer service in Canada that I have ever had. I have been with the td for 20 years and they have systematically fallen into chaos every year since I opened my account. The customer service has become rude with a guise of happy shiny faces whom don't know the answer to any questions you ask them. Trying to get online or call service help takes up to an hour due to the useless info they spew at you before someone answers. This is almost always followed up with someone hanging up on you within min of answering. If you can chose another banking institution, please do so."
61,"I have a car loan with TD....simply trying to gain access to see my loan on their 'easyweb' is the WORST. 3 days and 2 trips to the branch later, during a pandemic, I still don't have access!!!! All I want to do is pay you. I will never bank with you simply because of this. On a positive note, every employee has been very friendly. No one can help me, but they are very friendly."
62,Terrible serviceHave accounts in Canada and USANot convenient at all. (although they claim to be America's most convenient bank)Stick with Wells or BOA.The system runs this place and no one is competent enough to make a decision outside of what the computer tells them to do.To top it off - even when they read the computer script - their people still manage to screw it up.
63,"I went to the branch across Carlingwood mall in Ottawa for a wire transfer from Ontario to Quebec, between 2 Canadian banks! I was served by one teller and another one was standing next to her.She offered to do a draft as she needed more info for the wire transfer. The ONLY missing information was the SWIFT code. They could have told me to step aside and get back with the SWIFT code...they were 2 of them and it didn't cross their mind. I had handed my cellphone so she could see the specimen check with all the beneficiary's address, his bank's address, account number etc.... When I asked (already VERY upset) to speak to a manager, the teller handed me my cellphone back like I was a dog. The manager came and repeated they needed all the info that was IN FRONT OF THEM on the specimen check. So only the SWIFT code was missing. I told them it's all there, getting more and more upset at seeing 3 incompetent ladies with none offering me to step aside to look for the SWIFT code. The manager told me not to raise my voice against their staff and yelled at me ""do you want to leave? Do you want to leave?"" That was her way of offering me a solution!!! Of course I left as I felt scared she would call the police and given that I am black, I felt threatened and (I suspect she was totally profiling and racist) I just left. I called TD's number for complaints right after: USELESS. The representative at the 2nd level of escalation explained that they don't want to ""rush"" customers into providing wrong information: ughhh??? Did he even hear the reason for the complaint???? I wasn't disputing that they needed the SWIFT code and did not provide it themselves as a policy...I said I was shown the door instead of the opportunity to provide the ONLY piece of info missing that anyone can google. The result: I was not serviced, I felt discriminated against and I felt threatened that next step would be being another Black person in the hands of police (I shared the experience with many of my friends and they all suspect the TD representatives were profiling as well). Anyhow - I am not sponsoring racist behaviour by paying fees to a bank doing nothing to end it."
64,Terrible service!!!!!!!!!!! Waiting forever to get to customer service while they charge ridiculous fees
65,Use this app to trade. Constantly crashes and can’t sign in sometimes. Would not recommend this app for investing
66,worst customer service. If you ask them a question that they don't know the answer to they just hang up! I called 4 times each time waiting 40 minutes or more! Ridiculous!
67,"My access card got locked because TD thinks there’s a fraud in my transaction. Received a text message telling me to reply Y if it was me. I responded and my card was still locked. I called the number they told me to contact. waited 3 hours and still no representative picking up the phone. Went into a local branch and they said I had to call the same number and that only they could unlock the card. Waited another 3 hours and still nobody picking up. Honestly? The fraud prevention thing is good and all but they really need a better way for customers to unblock the card instead of waiting all day to get no answer and the card still being blocked. Useless call centres. I bank with TD and RBC, I can say that I like TD products more but RBC has way better customer service and ways of handling these situations, I have never waited more than an hour for RBC representatives to help me. Ridiculous"
68,People are nice once your call is actually answered but the big problem is the wait. On hold for an hour and a half now just to get access to my money to pay rent. Please consider hiring more people to answer phone calls as this is using up all of my minutes.
69,Always long telephone wait period compare to CIBC bank. It's challenging to connect phone and somebody will pick phone.
70,They have the worst customer service. I contacted them many times and after being on hold for an hour I get someone who simply hangs up. I am talking to my attorney now and will take TD to court and file lawsuit against them.
71,"Wish I could give ZERO STARS, as this is what they deserve. On hold for an hour after I noticed they took EXCESSIVE fees out of my account. Funny how these Canadian chartered banks manage to make billions annually, pay their executives millions and can’t bother to provide even a modicum of customer service."
72,"Like the rest of reviews mentioned, this greedy institutions only cares to enrich itself at the expense of its clients. They could have at least have a well trained and friendly customer service department, but no, probably one of the worst I have had to deal with in the last 5 years. Super rude, and apparently being openly racist either in-person at the counter or over-the phone is something that is widely accepted by TD, if not encouraged (based on my experience dealing with them for the last 4-5 years)"
73,"TD Bank loves taking your money but apparently they do not like helping you withdraw it back out of their bank. And yes, COVID has made this difficult for everyone, but we have all lost in one way or another. When you decide to bottleneck your already terrible customer service by closing half of your branches, you are making it impossible to ever have something fixed in a timely fashion! I don’t remember getting a COVID discount for having ten times the trouble getting an issue fixed (ie: a broken/missing debit card where I physically have to go in and not use an online service). It’s simple: we previously paid you whatever costs based on what you need to survive and profit; likewise you provided minimal service in keeping our money accessible and safe. Now we pay you the same yet you are half open and much more ineffective than ever. Doesn’t make sense to me but hey let the little guys just keep handing over their money to you. If I did not have an indebted account from school with TD, I’d have left a long time ago. I should be able to use my money when I want it not when the bank feels like it."
74,#1. My credit card is useless and gets blocked 3x per month. So I am forced to call in and speak with their piece of $hit customer service staff.The automated system asks you for a card number and always comes back as invalid. Finally get through and the a$$hole hangs up on me. Fvck TD.
75,"TD bank has to be one of the worst institutions I've worked with. I needed to set up a cross-border banking system since I work in Canada and live in the US. TD is one of the few banking options that offers this service, but it's got to be the most convoluted, expensive set up I've ever encountered. Setting up on the Canadian side took about 90 minutes in person, but required me to visit a branch in the US to establish that side of the equation. Without a local branch in my home state, I needed to call an 800 number, wait 30-45 min on hold, and spend another 30 min on the phone setting this up. This process took three or four times and a total of 10 weeks to get set up. Fees are astronomical, clocking in over $25 each month, plus transfer fees every time I needed to transfer my Canadian paycheck into my US account. Considering I get paid 2x monthly, these accounts cost me approx $50 month. Now I need to close the accounts, which is no easy task. To close my US account, I need to write a letter, get it notarized and snail mail the request--all because there is $4 balance (they're going to charge me a $15 maintenance fee tomorrow).  My canadian account had a balance of $14, and TD wanted to charge me a check and processing fee (I want to say it was $25) in order to close the account. Thankfully, I was able to donate that money to charity and close that side of the house. I've spent HOURS on the phone trying to complete normal, daily banking transactions - nothing too complicated. TD has made this task unbearable, inconvenient (ironic since my account is ""Convenience Checking"") and overall miserable. I'm not sure how I'll end this relationship with TD since they make it so difficult to close my account, but I can't wait to be done with them. Never again."
76,"I have banked with TD since I was 16! I’m 37 now and I tell you, their customer service has hit rock bottom. I’ve spent hours on hold while trying to talk with a rep about my insurance policies. I’ve decided to move all my banking else where. There is no incentive to be a loyal customer!"
77,Garbage Bank. Both TD Bank & TD Canada Trust.
78,"This is probably the worst customer service and technological interface for a bank that is allowed to do business in the USA. Beware and read the reviews prior to doing any business. You have been warned! I signed up for automatic payments and then received calls about no payments received, I called and they informed me that it takes 45 days to finalize automatic payments. If you change the amount of the payment then it will take another 45 days to finalize. In a modern digital world that is unacceptable. It's 2020 not 1980."
79,"Worst bank in canada, charged too much. Scam bank of canada and rude customers services."
80,"TD bank is worst. They hold fund for more than 10 days and keep charging overdraft fee. The customer service is useless. I called Branch in Rockway,NY.  It was also useless. I had to call many times to get back my overdraft fee. I’m closing my account soon."
81,"There was some transaction problem going on with my credit card and hence, I tried to contact TD, hoping that they could help. But, opposite of what I was hoping for, the customer service was incredibly terrible as the agent kept on insisting that my problem has never existed in the first place. Furthermore, she was extremely condescending by repeating the same thing regarding how pending and posted transaction works despite the fact that I told her I have been with TD for over 10 years. So terrible! This whole experience really made me reconsider my decision to continue staying with this bank..."
82,Been with this bank for 12 years now and they still won’t qualify me for an overdraft - won’t be using this bank for my inheritance that’s for sure .
83,Customer service does not call you back if the call drops and you have to wait on hold forever to get someone else and start the dispute all over again! They say they can not call and forced to take the next incoming call! Nevermind it takes 5 munutes just to get through all there questions. Call a branch for customer service!
84,"My worst experience ever, I am here right now at TD Millwoods Hewes Way branch July 23 at 5 pm it is raining and because of their not so client friendly virtual  line policy for covid they let us get wet from rain. They don't let us go even on the side of the bank to get shade from rain, I was asked to go out I went under pine tree so not to get soaked from rain.Other bank have better ways dealing with covid for their clients. Not happy with my experience today."
85,Stay away run for your life I have used CIBC and there better so far after a Year and the other one who is totally incompetent is Scotia bank but i was with Scotia 20 years and all of sudden they fell apart and TD i think has fallen apart from the get go terrible service agents none of them have the same info you think they would have same standards from agent to agent very strange. Anyways I am not recommending CIBC but have better relations with them to this point. I have my mortgage credit card and Auto load with them. TD screwed me over on a auto loan that's why i switched and they where in the wrong an didn't correct it to my satisfaction I did get a sorry but no resolution on the matter.
86,"I was a fraud victim not once but 3x with TD! the 10$ that was taken out from my bank was not returned by TD, the 3rd time since they advised to go to the bank to get another card which I only did less than a month ago, did fraud alerts with my new card (nothing happened) very poor security system!and I have bills coming the next day and I cannot go to the bank the next day,was taken out of my account and unfortunately I can no longer access my online banking,phoned contact center and waited for 2hrs while I am working!how nuissance!and was just told that i was informed to go to the bank immediately?what the heck?! very inconvenient, I am busy person working night shift as health care aide and had to sleep in the morning since another job by the afternoon,and only asking for that I hope I will not get charged of the NSF since I cannot deposit money from my other bank to TD!because I have to go personally to the bank, I need to get it to my schedule too! such a hassle! and take note money was taken out from my account and had to wait for 3-5business day to get back my money,and I have to deposit the difference of it and all I want  is for them not to charge with the NSF,since bottomline it is not my fault why they have to deactivate my online banking because of their poor security system!"
87,"I am very upset and i am going to take this to the top, I went to this location today @ 2:03PM i made a deposit into the TD ATM, no i am not a banker with TD bank how ever i used TD bank ATM machine, only to find out by my bank that i used the wrong ATM, i asked an employee there how to resolve the situation, first of all they are the rudest customer service folks i have ever  encountered in my life.  They did not help me one bit afetr given me the run around i call their customer service and was told that even thoe i am not a banker that they can run the ATM records and see the extra $$.  I went back to the bank and spoke to a Rebeca Baez who advised me that she was the manager and that i should call my bank, i let her know that if i used the wrong ATM my bank wont be able to see any deposit and they cant help me because on their end its not showing any deposit.   Then she told me that the ATM inside the bank is a third party ATM and they cant help me.  The ATM machine clearly says TD bank, i asked for the information to contact the third party ATM she told me that she can't help me, i asked for TD corporate office information she told me that they dont have a corporate office.  I am beyond pissed of i am talking about a $500.00 deposit not a $20 deposit.  During this time of covid19 we don't have money to throw away, i lost my job and just received my first unemployment check in the mail and decided to save the rest on my card.  I need some answers from someone anyone how do i get my money back.  These folks at this location is the worst OMG  i am not going to stop until i get my money back. and all of the employees inside of this location was just laughing at me as if this is a funny situation not cool at all"
88,"First let me start by saying I am not one to write a bad review about a company, but enough is enough. I'm not even going to start to mention anything regarding their low quality service and high service charges. My frustration with TD is regarding my application for the CERB financial relief loan which was declined even though I was completely qualified for it !!! They never provided me with any feedback to why it was declined, or what other documents was required by me to get approved. What's even more frustrating is that I know so many people that were not even eligible for the financial relief loan and they were approved within a matter of days. None of them have faced any repercussions. They have taken the funds and has largely improved their circumstances. I NEED that loan because I have so many projects offered to me but I have no funds to start. I need to pay for labor, equipment rental, materials and supplies. Even the 20% upfront payment by my clients won't help me to start my projects. Basically if I don't get the loan ..... I lose my business that I have worked so hard to start. Even when speaking to friends and family that bank with other financial institutions, none of them that applied for the loan where declined.  Banks back in the day were established to help out communities by providing small businesses with loans or lines of credit so businesses can grow and prosper. Today banks... especially TD are in the business of destroying people's lives and future.  They are a very dangerous and horrible bank to do business with. Take my advice and bank with any other banking institution, just don't bank with TD !!!! CIBC here I come.  God bless 🙏"
89,"I received a very vague email demanding I carry out certain complex procedures with limited information. I wanted to check it wasn't a scam and ask for more information.No one answers the customer service line - they literally just don't pick up. If you accept the option to leave a voicemail it just hangs up on you.I would close my account, but the above issue relates to an account I thought I had already closed!"
90,Avoid this bank as much as you can. They are deducting a lot of money with out any reason. Specially please follow your credit card.
91,I can't beleive I got covid from this bank such in safe safety measures like I can't beleive this what kinda people you for working here
92,WITHOUT PREJUDICE I WOULD LIKE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS TO SPEAK ENGLISH
93,"I've had a small business account at TD for years.  Over the last few years I've noticed a deterioration in their overall service.  the worst being recently when I went to see a teller to SPECIFICALLY enable e-transfer on my access card.  Due to their screw up I had to go to the bank 3 times just to get it working.  When I contacted customer service after my card was unusable to make a payment (this was after my second bank trip) I was told by the rep that the tellers may may not have known which boxes to tick off on their screens when setting up the e-transfer and that it was my fault for not reading up more thoroughly on e-transfer so I could direct them better.  I asked him, why it was up to me to do the teller's job for them,  I don't work in a bank, its their job to set up the service I request and ask the necessary questions.   He eventually agreed with me and advised I complain to the branch manager. I suspect however that the incompetence lies further up the chain.  I've never experienced such gross stupidity. Changing banks."
94,"I wish there was a zero star option. Horrendous TD Canada trust customer service. Closed my credit card almost 4 months ago by paying everything in full. Customer service representative told me the balance included everything all the way down to pending transactions, interest on those transactions etc. Paid everything in full. Received a call 6 weeks later notifying me there's about $20 left in balance. Customer service representative apologizes saying that the previous representative made a mistake. And this is the final payment and nothing after this. 3 months later after the second payment, I mean 3 months later, I check my statement and there's money taken out to pay my ""credit card"". Called the customer service, told that my account is in collections department for unpaid balance. They took portion of the remaining balance out of my chequeing account to have the remaining amount still lingering around without letting me know!Called the collections department, the service representative was super rude and condescending. Asks me if I knew what balance and interest meant. Told me to call credit card customer service again. Called them back (3rd call), after long waiting, finally someone named Derek was on phone. He was the only guy who was able to help me out and closing my account (hopefully for good this time). He was polite and apologetic for previous representatives making mistakes. It's been four months and long phone calls and in still dealing with this. So happy I closed my credit card with them and will be moving everything out of this bank soon as I can."
95,"I agree with all the people who say TD has horrendous customer service. I went to the branch at 13318 50 STREET in Edmonton. A lot of us lined up outside only to be told we needed to register on their app to reserve a spot (when we can just line up at the branch downtown). When I got a text with the name of an employee to talk to, another employee inside the branch told me to stand in line instead. When I got to the counter, Norma couldn't answer my question about the endorsement on the back of the cheque. She also didn't know that my question was about standard banking procedure common to all banks and kept telling me to ask the bank that had issued the cheque. When I asked to talk to someone who could answer my question, she again told me to ask the bank that issued the cheque. (I'll have to do an internet search for the answer.) After I left the branch, I got another text saying that another employee was ready to see me. I texted back that I had already left, but the app didn't accept texts.When I opened my account at the downtown branch, the employee kept asking me how much money I had to transfer over from another bank. It's also staffed almost completely with ""customer service"" employees who usually can't answer your question and immigrants who don't understand English. Sadly, this is common for all banks now. They ask for ""customer service"" and ""sales"" experience in their job ads instead of banking knowledge."
96,"Recently retired, bank client for 25 years. Substantial investments in TD thru Direct Investing.Looking for unsecured line of credit to consolidate some small debt & received a ridiculous quote ..... especially when considering prime rate is 2.45.Very dissappointed. Rep said he wasnt able to do anything re the rate.Wasted about 1 1/2 hours.Looking to move all my business & investments elsewhere.Here to help with covid just a tagline."
97,"The absolute worst bank in the world. Terribly uneducated customer service staff, and so many hidden fees. Don't bother."
98,Be careful if you receive an offer in the mail to open a checking account with a $300 cash bonus.  They will renege on the offer.  Terrible customer service.
99,Terrible customer service. I am attempting to port my existing mortgage and my representative who is unavailable and will not get back to me. She said I was approved and I removed conditions. And now it’s sounding like a maybe. But I don’t know anything because she won’t confirm or communicate. And I am made to feel bad because I am asking questions on fees etc. Apparently you are supposed to sign blindly. Don’t use a mobile mortgage specialist. They can’t be bothered.
100,I am an investor with TD Waterhouse and use the online site every day. These outages are driving me crazy. This Bank has lost me money because the site was down and is down once again during a very busy trading session. Will be searching for a class action to put in a claim.
101,"First lost 60$ because their atm machine broke and couldn’t count my cash properly. It asked me to manually put how much money I inserted. After I did it deposited money falto my account, but in a week there was a -60 correction charge. After an hour of phone hold and a week of waiting a claim to resolve they did resolve it. In their own favor. They simply said “the error didn’t occur”, even thou it did. After that they introduce 3% fees on foreign transactions. These updates were not properly delivered, and I was charged extra 100 dollars on my recent purchases from international websites. The worst worst terrible bank. I had much more issues with them, but these two were extremely crazy since they just stole my money."
102,Worst bank ever more than an hour in drive thru. No one answers the phone. You have to give yourself a good hour and 1/2 to make one transaction.
103,"The worst service ever we had today at 608 Fanshawe Park Rd E, London, ON N5X 1L1, people are waiting in the hot sun for 3 to 4 hours in line to go to the teller, to take our money. The staff working at these locations don't have any knowledge of how to handle the situation,  very poor management, for the past 4 months most of the locations closed. WHY OUR MONEY STUCK LIKE THIS ?"
104,"This is the worst bank I have ever been a customer of. Their hold times exceed 1 hour each and every time I talk with anyone. They constantly will hand the phone call over to another department on their team which increases the hold time. I just finished waiting on hold for 2:24 minutes which is considerably short compared to the other times I have waited on hold. The calls continuously will disconnect and no one calls you back knowing your phone number as it is on your profile. They can't seem to figure out simple requests like transfering funds from one account to the next; even though they have a cross border team that directly handles these matters. They do not know what they are doing and I will NEVER be a customer with them again. Poor customer service. They also only have a few US banks across the United States. BEWARE setting up an account with them if you do not reside in these states. Once they close your account, its next to impossible to have them transfer your funds to you without directly going into the bank. Horrible experience."
105,The fees are very high if you don’t keep at least 5g in an account that earns zero interest.Their exchange rates are often a few cents lower than you can get elsewhere.Overall: pass on this financial institution if you aren’t being robbed by them already.
106,"Extremely poor service and ti be honest criminal with there overdrafts. Let me explain, if you deposit money or checks they hold the deposits , and that's understandable, but when a payment comes out, it post automatically. Meaning like now I made a deposit 3 days ago and it is still on hold or pending but the payment for my insurance posted right away. Meaning due to the pending deposit my payment will overdraft and I will be charged $35. The thing is, and I did a little experiment. Last week I deposited money the same way as I did the deposit that is pending now. Now eventhough it was the exact same amount and I deposited it the exact same way, the deposit last week was posted one day after I deposited it. So why isn't the deposit from three days ago ,that was deposited the same way, being held or pending for three days and still pending. My conclusion is they know my insurance comes out the same time every month , so It is obvious that they hold or keep deposits pending simply to make a quick $35. If I'm wrong then explain why two deposits done the exact same way for the exact same amount is posted within a day last week while the other gets held for three to four days when you have a payment coming due. PRETTY CONVENIANT FOR THEM DONT YOU THINK.TD Bank are nothing but a bunch if high class thieves in suits and they get away with stealing your money. Plain and simple they should be behind freaking bars with the rest of the criminals."
107,"I can give you zero star if there is option, because TD bank is not able  to safe money of their clients. worst  bank ever seen in my life. I never share any information to anyone, i live alone, i didn't use card at any store and nobody knows that i have td account but still my account number get in hand of any fraud person. So that mean this information leak inside of bank. other thing is that customer care people who is in claim department and helping department are misguiding me and give wrong information. so I recommended everyone that please stay away from this bank, you  should try other bank. if you have lots of money and you don't know where you want to spend, give it to td bank."
108,"Worst place to place your money. My account is being depleted by service fee's, unannounced ""withdrawal"" fee's, and then the supposed account fee. I would definitely be ahead if I ""stuffed"" my money in a mattress. I will be leaving this institution ( which I've been with for 20+ years ) in the very near future"
109,"This Bank doesn't care about customer. I see one of the worse customer service here. If you call customer service, make sure you have 2 hours free time to spend with them. Waiting time may be hour or more."
110,"The worst customer service!For a very simple issue, I called 4 times and wasted 1 hour each time on the phone and at the end they asked me to go to the branch. Most of the branches are closed though...."
111,"Probably the worst online service I have ever experienced when attempting to set up a bank account. 3 different agents, 3 different things said and I still have to go in person to my nearest branch an hour away during COVID. CIBC made this process infinitely easier."
112,"The worst custimer service ever . I am a single mom and was effected by Covid 19. For the past 3 months I called 4-5 times to ask for deferral of interest rates on my credit cards that are closed . I’m just paying them off at the moment. Nobody called me back . Nothing was done . I went to the branch directly and they gave a different number . I called there as well . Nothing!  Nobody calls back and when I speak to somebody they also find an excuse why is taking so long, because it’s a closed account . Another time I called regarding the cash back that I earned . I asked it to be applied towards the balance . They refused and then hang up on me . I cannot imagine how rude and awful customer service . When they need to get as a customer they promise all the stuff . When it’s time for us to get the benefits there will always be an excuse why it cannot be done ."
113,TD Bank is the worst bank a bank with the past three years I've been holding my check for 5 days for no reason even though I get the same deposit from the same company just a bunch of racist ass bank and I'm definitely ending my business with them
114,"Trying to get a mortgage through the bank that I have been with for YEARS, waited for two weeks to hear from Navan Kang the supposed mobile mortgage specialist, didn't hear anything until I told him I wanted a call that day or I would be going elsewhere for my mortgage AND my banking. Still waiting for a call, if I do not get one today TD can say so long to my 10 plus years of patronage. I'm gone getting thrown around and not hearing from the people who have been given the empty title of SENIOR MANAGER. What a joke."
115,I called about an unknown fee coming off my credit card. The man I spoke to told me to “pay off the card in full”. I told him that due to the pandemic I was unable to at the moment. He said “yes while that’s pretty much coming to an end now”. I told him not for those with suppressed immune systems such as myself and he just said okay. I never enjoying dealing with this bank.
116,Terrible bankThis bank doesn’t care about customers.
117,"If i could give ""0"" star i would! Horrible / unreliable bank that i've ever work with. Close my account , with $0 ballance - moved out and 12 years later i got a bill for overdraft $-1080."
118,"I’ve been holding this story for a while now. I needed to renew my $100000 mortgage from Td. I looked up the going rate and made an appointment. Easy , right. When I got to the appointment (I am black), and to my surprise the woman offered me a rate 1:5% higher than the published rate! She told me that if I didn’t sign now it would be higher later. I went to my car called another bank and after checking my credit and assets got a mortgage the same day 1/2% lower than the going rate. Td, my bank for 30 years, didn’t even look at my investments or savings , even after I asked her to check my record with them.Two months later, my (white) best friend, and neighbour, went to Td to renew her mortgage and got an offer immediately 2% less than I was offered. Hmmmmmm!!!"
119,"I ended up being apart of an identity theft issue and my bank account was hacked, over $2000 dollars was taken. This happened in May, it's almost July now and they still haven't fully fixed it. TD doesn't protect your money.At one point they froze my account but the bank was still taking money from my account, THE BANK NOT THE ID THIEVES, and they said I can no longer use e transfer because of it even though I'm the victim. Once this is resolved I'm closing my account. This is ridiculous."
120,"Thiefs, currently going trough process to sue them i opened my bank account online they never adk id or to go to branch then i put money in my account then they told me to go to a branch and wich im never gonna do so ya they robbed me 500$ they wont send my money back by cheque. People need to wake up and boycott td there real thiefs i have all the proof for that!"
121,I have never been on hold so many times for so long they failed to do their job and release a construction loan 14 years ago now it is a nightmare and is causing us to lose a buyer on our house.completely unacceptable completely unprofessional.  we have 5 accounts with them we are pulling all of our accounts. I recommend that everybody stays totally clear from TD bank
122,The td app and even online banking if you make it home to a computer are terrible.  They hardly ever are operational! It's so frustrating to only be able to access your banking info 30% of the time.
123,Bank charging me monthly withdrawal fees on my unlimited withdrawal. Nothing but a rip off from TD.  I could actually save money keeping my money at home
124,"out of all the banks. this one is far behind on their easyweb and app (features), you have to carry your td card everywhere you go very inconvenient there for dropping td to keep my other banks.They also scam you everychance they get. i used my card 5 times over (transactions) and they charged me 75$ for it. Dnt do international transfer id they do theyll charge you so many fees youll lose all of it. no google pay or android pay or samsung pay total useless. better stick with my other banks which they support everything. even desjardins is a better option which is already garbage"
125,This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with.  I do not care if it is interest free for 3 years.....I would rather pay 30% interest then to deal with this company.  I have never had an issue paying any debt but this company makes it impossible.  I have called 3 times only to wait on hold for a hour each time to verify my account number is correct.  The account number is drafted one month and the next month it doesn't work....seems like an internal issue.  Instead of calling you to discuss they send you a letter in the mail that comes 3 weeks later (after the due date has past) to inform you the transaction did not go through.  So you get a late fee.....for their error.  This bank is a joke.....Avoid at all cost!
126,THIS BANK BRANCH IS AN ABSOLUTE THEIF! ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS STEALING OUR MONEY TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICHER. THEY ACTUALLY TOLD ME TODAY THAT A OVERDRAFT FEE WILL BE APPLIED TO A CREDIT SALE IF THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT ON THE DAY THE SALE WAS CHARGED AND THAT IT DOESNT MATTER IF THERE WAS MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT WHEN THE CREDIT SALE CLEARED. IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT 3 DAYS FOR A CREDIT SALE TO CLEAR AND THEY SAID THEY DONT COUNT THE DATE IT CLEARS THEY CHARGE IT ON THE DAY IT WAS CHARGED! ITS JUTS ANOTHER WAY FOR THEM TO TAKE MONEY FROM US! I SWEAR I AM LEAVING THIS BANK ASAP BECAUSE OF THIS HIDDEN RULE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO SNEAK INTO THERE LAWS. THEY HAVE APPLIED OVER $200 IN OVERDRAFT FEES IN MY ACCOUNT WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND EVERY FEE HAS BEEN THEIR ERRORS. WHEN IS THERE GOING TO BE A BANK THAT HELPS THERE CUSTOERMS AND CARES FOR THEM AS PEOPLE? THEY ALL ONLY CARE ABOUT MAKING THEIR POCKETS BIGGER.
127,"TD has THE WORST customer service, phone wait time, and e.ployee training. they incompetent, rude, morons who do not deserve to continue as a business. a complete joke of a company."
128,"EasyWeb doesn't let you print receipts, just statements. Very behind compared to the other major banks in Canada."
129,"So I have a very old account with TD and my part time job's pay goes into it.Today I went to the branch at McCowan and lawrence wanting to buy a draft.  I am a senior.  Teller told me I have to have a special 60+ account in order to waive the fee.  I said I do not want to open up another account and showed the teller my driver's licence.  He wont accept that except repeating the same like a record.  I asked for the supervisor, same damn answer.  I walked out of there without a draft ($9 is a lot of money for seniors).Damn TD.  Am thinking about closing my account and have nothing to do with them!"
130,I have lived at my address for 4 years and am still getting mail for the previous tenant.I have have returned every single letter stating moved and have called TD so many times and am still receiving their mail.I have spent too much time on this and am disgusted that nothing has been done
131,"I called TD bank customer service to get help over the phone and I stayed on the phone for thirty minutes, finally a lady answered and she was really rude. I told her I wanted my wife to help me answer questions but she said no I will get you a translator but she hang up on me. I will be closing my TD bank account as soon as possible as this is not the first time they have done this to me."
132,ive had nothing but bad experiences with this bank since i started. take your money and business elsewhere.
133,"Do NOT waste your time, money & putting any energy into TD Bank! This is a heartless company with horrible customer service!!"
134,Was making car purchase and got locked out of my account.  Took over 3 hours on hold to get through to anybody all because I made 2 other e transfers. Of course theres going to be more than one e transfer when all you can send at a time is $3000. Horrible experience. I had to use western union and cost me extra $108. TD should be paying me back that $108 but all they like to do is take your money not give you money....as everyone already knows.
135,"I have been with TD Bank for years...no big problems until now. I deposited a $3800 commission check by mobile deposit. They have put a hold on it until the 15th. I haven't had a paycheck in 2 months and this is putting me in a bad position. I called the bank the check is drawn on and the manager said the money is there and no reason for this. I think the reason is that TD bank, having less deposits now, is going to draw interest on my money and a lot of other people. Thanks to this pandemic I have lost a business, I have not received ANY help from the government including my stimulus check and now this bank is holding the only money I have! STAY AWAY!"
136,Do not ever take an auto loan at TD Bank. After five years of automatic payments they claim they sent me a letter saying my last payment had to be made a different way. I decided to trade the vehicle for a newer model and realized I did not have the title. Called TD and talked to a real jerk who said I was late making payment. Lived at the same address and same telephone for about forty years and never once did I hear from anybody from TD Bank. Not only did I have to make late payment but they crucified my credit report. I wonder how many others this happened to. Maybe it is a scam
137,"TD Bank canada  wont listen and will not admit they are ever wrong they  rude, arrogant and incompetent, they are  the worst of the worst, They have frozen my accounts 3 times now in the past 6 months with no notification, the latest freeze on my bank accounts was  because they say its suspicious I was transferring $30 between 2 of my TD accounts, they also  refused to renew credit cards even though the cards were below the limit and not behind in any payments,Customer service is disgusting and argue with the customer, blatantly lie and just disconnect the customer when they are losing the issue, Even the branch managers are arrogant and fail to respond to high level complaints, I have now cancelled my accounts with TD Canada,along with at least 15 other customers I know of personally,  If I could give zero or minus stars on my review I would,"
138,"This one star is basically a consolation prize for TD because i know, that NO human being, in their right mind, would give this bank a good rating. I had 480$ withdrawn from my account by some fraudulent source, when i reported it to TD, they ""invesitgated"" the charge for a month, before dismissing it and refusing to pay back the money. So i withdrew the full balance of my chequing account, plus overdrew the account by 480$ ( the money they rightfully owe me ) and told them i would not be paying back the overdraft, as they had basically stolen that money and as my bank it was THEIR responsibility to keep the money safe. I am now in a legal battle with TD because they are trying to sue me to get back the 480 i took from them. Do not bank with TD, they are not here for you, they are here to get YOUR MONEY, into THEIR POCKETS."
139,"If I could give TD Bank a lower score than 1 I would this branch is absolutely horrible.poor customer service. So they locked my account on Friday and the bank is closed all weekend due to COVID-19 there was no advanced notice of this my account just got frozen.  Then I call Customer service and the TD Customer service won't tell me  anything or give me any information and just tell me to call 1-855-210-8310 they would not even tell you what that department is and just hung up on me multiple times!  I call that number it is closed until the Monday.  I left 3 voice mail messages at that number with no response.  My account was locked I had money in my bank account with no access to it the account was frozen. The Toronto Dominion bank is horrible and provide horrible customer service.  I later came to find out that the number they were telling me to call 1-855-210-8310 is the Toronto Dominion Bank ""De-marketing department"" if they want to drop you as a customer they lock your account with no cause and demand that you call this department. If you get a phone call from this number don't answer or if TD tells you to call this number don't do it and just call a lawyer!  TD Bank are pure scumbags!  I closed my account with these clowns and will never go back!"
140,I find it appalling during this time with covid that they have reduced their hours.  So now many many many people have to stand in line and wait!  And they do nothing for the people that are still working through this and are unable to get to the bank during their miserly open times.  Been a customer for 40 years but time to find a new bank!!
141,"Honestly, the services at TD are pretty good. We love their no-fee credit card, their flat monthly fee, and their very friendly tellers. HOWEVER; the whole reason I felt the need to write this review is because of what I have seen happen to people close to me, and how utterly appalling I think it is.The majority of frauds and scams are (or at least used to be) based on checks. People will deposit these checks at TD bank, send some of the money back to the scammer, and supposedly keep the rest. These can be in the amounts of hundreds all the way up to millions and most people CANNOT absorb this loss. TD will tell you after the fact that the check did not clear and the money never existed.WHY on earth are they putting money in your account (the amount on the check) and allowing people to withdraw or spend it when it was never real and never belonged to the person in question?? People trust their banks and I can't tell you how big the sense of betrayal is when they are suddenly demanding the person ""return the money to them,"" all while blaming the victims 100% no matter how they were defrauded, and sitting there with a lawyer who is telling you what will happen if you don't pay them back.I fear this issue is deep and far reaching in the financial industry. But until TD starts taking responsibility for THEIR contribution to fraud; giving people money that isn't real. There is no reason whatsoever to do this. Simply wait until the money is confirmed. The second way they contribute to fraud is when someone is fraudulently taking money from your account, doing it without permission, etc, YOU, the customer are told you need to pay a regular monthly fee for each person/corporation you want to block from charging your account. How can they tell people, when they are the ones being paid to protect and securely store your money, that we must pay every month to stop someone from stealing that money, for as long as they are trying to do it? Once again, all the responsibility is put on someone else for something that is a part of their job. if TD fixed these issues I would be giving at least a 4 star rating, but it hurts my heart that anyone would go to such lengths to avoid accountability and cause further harm to victims of crime."
142,I could give them ZERO stars if I could. By far the WORST bank / customer service EVER. Their representatives have horrible customer service!!!!!!!!! TD is suppose to be a big branch name - the workers do not know or understand their own policies. Took over 6 months to resolve an issue that still isn’t resolved. Management doesn’t even call customers back AT ALL when they say they will.  I have been a loyal customer for more then 25 years. Time to find a different bank. Credit card expired. Waited weeks/months. Card expired. And still didn’t receive it. Because of covid I have lost hours at work and rely on my credit card and unfortunately did not have a credit card for weeks. How does TD except people to live. They don’t care about their customers at all!!! Nor do they take any responsibility for anything. HORRIBLE customer service!!!!
143,"Extremely bad customer service. No manners, asking tens of unnecessary and irrelevant questions when called to resolve an issue."
144,"Ok so I'm cool usually with TD. then they said if i can put over 10k in a savings account, there is an interest of 1.05% monthly. So i go hunt in my other accounts for this... then 2 months later,Without anyyyyyy notice, there is no interest rate. I waited till followin month, still nothin so I call. They say oh yeah, interest rate dropped to p0.1 like 3 month ago. Im like but i didn't get any notice to move my money elsewhere, they say.. the only way you will know is ny checking that you did not receive the interest at the end of the month. They're so unbelievably disrespectful, i was shocked that no notice was sent. It's my money."
145,"They need to add ""Zero Stars"" because one out of five is way too much. Dave McAdams is possibly one of the most cruel and evil persons on the planet.  Google this Devil  and see how many lives he has destroyed by his timing.He would make Stalin proud and the devil seem tame. A vampire eating flesh is Dave McAdams hurting people in the middle of Covid-19.Never Bank with TD. If you do close your accounts yesterday or pay the price. Banked with them over 10 years. Horrible I regret leaving sooner and everyone I know feels the same!"
146,"What a joke. If you have a small business and are thinking of opening an account then think again. HORRIBLE “service” and “policies”. My business just started operating after 2 months due to covid. I have insurance & vehicle payments etc coming out and now that customers are starting to send out cheques they won’t release our money. I have a cheque from the art gallery of Ontario but they couldn’t release ANY of the funds. I’ve had nothing but problems, never bounced a cheque and still I’m treated like I’m giving them a bad cheque. The Art gallery of Ontario doesn’t bounce $6000.00 cheque’s. I’ll be closing my account and going to CIBC where they understand how to maintain a customer relationship. -100/10. Horrible. Thanks for “helping” me through these times. 👋"
147,"I get it, COVID-19 has been difficult for everyone and most organizations. I expect longer than average wait times, a lower level of customer service and general inconvenience, but the absolutely terrible level of customer service provided by TD over the last few months is, and continues to be, just awful.  Unfortunately, it seems to be getting worse, and no one there seems to care in the least.  My personal and professional accounts are tied to this bank so I am all too familiar with excessively long hold times (only to be disconnected, numerous times), multiple requests to have a standard form filled out, only to have it filled out incorrectly when it was completed (resulting in our annual audit being delayed), company credit cards arriving with names spelled incorrectly (after an almost four month wait when I was told it would take two weeks) and a new virtual check in that no one bothered to explain to those of us lined-up outside for a half hour before opening.  I have been unable to get tax documents since February becausee people ""are working from home"" and when you ask to speak to manager they don't seem to care and direct you to their phone lines which, inevitably, disconnect you--sometimes after holding for 40 minutes.  Again, I understand we are in unusual times, but TD has to get it together like other banks seem to have done."
148,"The customer service line makes you jump through so many hoops just to get put on hold and wait for a real person to talk to. I called three times this morning and got immediately disconnected by the first ""real person"", transferred by the second real person to an office that was not open. The third time I was on hold for 40 minutes only to be answered and disconnected again. All of our local branches are closed due to the pandemic, you would think they would step up their customer service. It could not have been worse, I do not recommend this bank."
149,This bank has been a nightmare I’ve been on hold for an hour deal with some banking issues and when they even answer they give me the worse attitude and now that I closed my bank account with them there supposed to send me a check with my remaining balance and still haven’t received it and I just called and they told me it’s still not in the process I could not believe it even knowing the crisis we are going through right now they don’t even care and I’ve been on hold I went to talk to them and I even been waiting and there still not doing there part I wanted to leave this review to let everyone know not to bank with them they definitely don’t care about there customers and it’s sad I would just to happen to prevent this to happening to anyone else.
150,"Customer service by phone has really declined. It took 4 phone calls and almost 2 hours just to activate my daughter’s youth account. A task that should have been without complication turned into being disconnected, on hold for over 30 minutes, rude representatives and at the end? They attached the debit card to the wrong account. They took no accountability. I’ve banked with TD for many years and not a happy customer after this experience."
151,"WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH ANYONE. MY CARDS ARE FROZEN AND I AM UNABLE TO PURCHASE ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING AND CANT UNFREEZE BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE. THE WORST PART IS THAT THEY USE THE PANDEMIC AS AN EXCUSE!!!!!!!!! IN A PANDEMIC YOU WOULD THINK ANY SMART COMPANY WOULD SHIFT THEIR FOCUS OVER TO IMPROVE THEIR REMOTE OPERATIONS... NOT TD!! THEY DESERVE TO LOSE ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM ANYWAYS. NOTHING BUT HATE AND DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THIS STUPID BANK. ""20 minute wait time"" IT HAS BEEN A WHOLE WEEK AND I CANT REACH ANYONE. SO FRUSTRATING"
152,Worst bank. Can’t get in contact with anyone. I have been trying to call them for days and after few minutes to an hour of waiting they HANG UP. I called them in April about fraudulent charge that they in the end dismissed the charge and didn’t reward the money back to the account. What they didn’t say is they were going to FREEZE ALL of my funds without any notice during a PANDEMIC. It’s been a week now that they have said it will be unfrozen and I still can’t even pay for groceries. And they won’t pick up. This is disgusting.
153,I'm so thrilled one of the richest banks in North America is still compounding the interest on my mortgage during a pandemic. It's not as if the interest they were going to earn on the term is changing... It's just being delayed. Morally repugnant.
154,"They locked my debit/credit card for absolute no reason and told me that my card *may* have been frauded. I found out when I was about to pay for my week’s groceries. I checked online and I was able to log in fine and my financial statement showed it was all fine and i did not see any strange transactions that when out from the account. They told me to call their lost and prevention when it’s already been wasting my time ridiculously. So I called lost prevention, it took me almost 2 total days to reach to someone to talk to. Meaning me and my kids were just ordering food waiting for these slow guys to respond. Do not work with TD its absolute horse business.0"
155,"Complaint about customer service - Sooke, BC BranchToday, May 12, I visited the Sooke branch to make a modest cash deposit to my checking account.There was no one at the door and there were just the tellers inside the branch so I proceeded to the ATM machine located inside the building, right by the entrance.For some reason the ATM won't accept my cash so I proceeded inside the branch to make a deposit with one of the available tellers.This is when I heard a loud harsh voice behind my back ""Hey! You can't just come in like that!""I came back out to the branch door and saw one of  the TD employees starting angrily at me. He was the one who addressed me as Hey.So I said, ""Sorry if I inadvertently broke any rules. I am ready to follow the rules. But maybe you should not address your customers as Hey.""This TD employee made a few steps towards me and positioned himself a bit too close to me, as if he had the intention of getting right in my face.Then - trying to stare me down - and standing way too close - he proceeded with lecturing me for about 3 minutes about the importance of obeying the rules. He was speaking in a very loud and harsh voice, as if he was trying to intimidate me.He looked visibly angry and annoyed.Later I was surprised to find out that I was talking to the Sooke branch manager who identified himself as John Lawson.I totally understand the importance of safety and obeying the rules during current challenging times.I do my best to follow the rules of social distancing!However our existing COVID19 restrictions do not make the behavior of  John Lawson - described above - in any way acceptable or justifiable.I keep wondering, would John Lawson treat a tall male customer the same way he treated me? Why does John Lawson think it is acceptable to address any of his customers as Hey?I think filing this complaint is important because this experience was quite traumatic. I sincerely hope that no other customers of the Sooke TD branch will ever be treated this way!"
156,"Ok- we have to wait in line these days, and confirm that we are not sick, or been exposed to covid-19. But now, the gargoyles at the gate want all kinds of info (cell phone #, nature of business, etc). Who had this brain fart? I WILL NOT answer that while I am in line, surrounded by others. My business is between me and the teller who serves me. I do not get met at the door of Giant Tiger to be asked which department I will be accessing during my shopping. Then today, at 11:50 a.m. I am told that I cannot use the ATM until noon, as the 11-12 time is reserved for seniors. THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE MACHINES. Wow. Can we please please please just get to the place where we can accomplish our tasks again in a normal fashion???-"
157,"Horrible! They put a hold on the CC without telling me. I had to call them in order to fix this. First person that answered the phone verified me and said that they will have to transfer me and that I will not need to be verified again, since I did not have much time to spare. The second person asked again verification questions and did not care about the fact that their colleague said I do not need to spend more time on random questions. Asked for the manager, since the person seemed incompetent and not understanding of the situation.Adina, the manager was even worse. She kept wasting our time with more random questions. Overall experience is extremely unpleasant. I really hope that they take into consideration client reviews"
158,"Absolutely horrible and the worst bank I’ve ever dealt with in my life. I get that there is a pandemic going on but they should be willing to help and work more with there clients during this time. I had issues with someone somehow getting access to my card information and needed to close my account and open a new one I was told I can’t go into a bank for this and to do it online so I did and I opened a new one and I had needed to cash a cheque again no branches open so I had no choice but to use the mobile app I was on the phone with and told the supervisor.  I should probably wait to close the other account until end of the month and just transfer all immediate funds into the new account I opened she convinced me to close it since I have opened the new one. So I did!  the next day I called to ask about my chq and having access to at least a 100$ like I always have in The past. They told me i can’t access none Of my money. I was upset and asked to be transferred to a supervisor after being transferred to 4 different agents not a supervisor like I ASKED for and 3 1/2 hours on the phone I was told no I can’t be released a 100$ Of MY MONEY like the previous supervisor told me. I’d have to call back the next day and they would return me 50$ of my bank fees I didn’t ask for!! And to call back tomorrow they could work with me than to release the 100$ as the chq was already a week late and I desperately needed my money to get groceries as I had next to nothing at this point I was livid. But I did and called the NEXT day, So after another 2hours of my life wasted on hold I was finally transferred to a supervisor who said no we can’t release you 100$ from the chq while holding the rest for 5 business days. We just gave You 50$ I said I didn’t ask for that I need 100$ not half. But he said okay well It is a td chq so we can release it most likely on Monday or Tuesday for you. 😡😡😡 so I called AGAINNN!! Today TUESDAY like the supervisor told me... Another hour on hold for the supervisor to tell me no they can’t release even a 100$ for me because I closed my old account and only opened this new one wk ago something his supervisors convinced me to do. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 than on top of that they are holding the full amount for 5 business and told me it’s on may 19th That is when I can access MY MONEY!! 😡😡😡 that’s two god damn weeks not 5 business days. I have an appointment set up with scotia bank and once my funds are released I will be closing my long time account with them and will NEVER deal with this trash bank again! I spent a Total of 8 hours on the phone to be lied to repeatly and denied access to my own money when I have a toddler at home who has needs! I’m livid and disgusted. Forcing me to have to go apply for a loan today, and borrow from ppl to feed my child when I have money that they aren’t giving me my own money. And an extremely long hold and wasted 8 hours of my life. I spoke with my sister she deposited a chq the same way through an atm because no branches are open and her pay cheque was held almost two wks as well and caused her to be 10 days late on her rent.  Worst bank and customer service everrr"
159,"I HATE HATE HATE TDBANK. Everytime I'm on their phone line hearing ""America's Most Convenient Bank"" I want to throw up in disgust. They unilaterally disabled my foreign wire transfer access with no notice as to why, and now that I want to reenable it, I can't do it via the phone, I'm told that I must do it in person. Great. Except that all the stores are closed due to the lockdown, and apparently their phones are not being manned either. Policies that don't make any sense. And I'd understand given the circumstances, but this is just the latest of a long long line of issues I've had with TD Bank. It's gotten to the point that I get anxious when I call them, because I'm steeling myself to get a runaround because I know that the person I'm going to talk to is not going to be able to do anything for me, and just ask me to go to the branch, which is the one thing I cannot do, which is why I'm calling. I do not feel like TD Bank cares about their customer experience at all, and so their tag line truly infuriates me. TD Bank, please, just be honest with yourself."
160,If their was no star I would of picked that! Td promotes they help small business ... TD Canada trust you do absolutely NOTHING to support small businesses ! I asked for a secondary business card with a limit for one of my guys. I was told no problem by more then one person from td yes just bring him in we’ll get him to sign his name show some id and you will get new card with limit ... so I bring one of my workers to the bank mind you I paying for them to sit there with me ... 45 mins later they tell me I half to sign over power of attorney! Why are you just telling me this now ? Because you guys expect us to do your job that’s why .
161,"If this app would allow, my rating would have been in the negative.Being a client of TD Canada Trust even before they merged, over 25 years, I believe I have enough experience to write this I usually don't have a problem. I follow the rules, and enjoy the perks of Xtra hours and weekend banking.You would think after so long I would have earned a little respect in turn.My home branch, in Ottawa Blossom Park, is amazing. Small town mentality and personality makes every banking experience easy and helpful.However, due to the Virus Covid, our branch is one not currently available. I was forced to visit a bank I don't often patron. They are rotating employees also, so it's basically like using the machine.Trying to deposit my paycheck, that is a company check also with TD I may add, was a nightmare.After waiting in the cold outside for over an hour, I finally was able to speak to a teller. Because of identity theft in past, I don't subscribe to convenient offers such as the photo-cheque app, or even same day bank machine deposit/withdrawal. I don't have the tap on my card, and prefer to go in person when depositing my $.Im a little off grid, so refuse credit. We live with the rule if we can't pay for it today, we don't buy it today.This is as hindering as it is useful. The teller was young, and I automatically felt a vibe he was judging me. I do construction for a living, and taking lunch hour to do this was my only opportunity. We were already in danger of BSF charges due to the bank not being available on weekends.I was a mess, already late for returning to work, and dirty from doing drywall. He said nothing to me, and proceeded to look through my account...forever. He went back as far as 2 years and began asking me personal questions about my purchases with MY money. He then told me the teller has the choice of holding the funds for up to 7 days..if they feel it's warranted.He then told me he would be doing this to mine. No explanation, no reason, nothing.When I explained iv never had my previous checks from same company be an issue, and my auto withdrawals for rent, hydro, water and my transport to and from work will be severely compromised, he said ""too bad..I can't do anything about that."" Literally..it was an obvious power trip, and condradiction.I asked to speak to a manager. He told me it was my right, and left to find one. During this time I noticed reactions from other tellers, and customers. They all have the look of, poor you, hope this doesn't happen to me, followed by the slight smile of empathy.He returned and told me the supervisor said it was up to the teller, and that it was out of his hands.Tears started. I was tired, broke, in danger of losing my job as I now had no way back to work. Not to mention the hundreds of dollars of NSF charges I was going to lose because of ""his decision"".I told him that I wanted to speak with the manager..not him for me!If a legit reason was given I'd get it.However considering the hardships, and changes we ALL are facing due to the virus, I really thought people would be less problematic.I had no choice but to deposit with the hold. I begged, made a reasonable and acceptable case for my side. But the more I seemed distressed and tried, the more he seemed to enjoy himself.This put my time at 2 1/2 hours!Another patron actually felt sorry for the ordeal, and drove me to work. God bless him.Now iv had time to investigate.Because the cheque was a TD account cheque, there was no reason for him not to check the funds being available, and deposit my pay.I don't even need an account to do this apparently!It doesn't stop there!When going on easyline, to speak to someone regarding this, the first guy put me on hold, and hung up on me.The second, told me there wasn't anything he could tell me or do..then hung up on me.Finally, the third, was an angel.He listened, explained, and investigated.He did the right thing.I may not have alot..but TD isn't getting it."
162,"I live near postal code M4P1J2 & I normally bank with TD @the 2169 Yonge Street location. The ATMS at this location are shut down as well.It is unbelievable that most of the branches in this area that are shut down!! Sure I know that COVID19 is very apparent, but why are so many of their branches shut down right now? This whole situation is a very sad state of affairs & IT REFLECTS VERY POORLY ON THE TD BANK. I can understand that most banks are reducing their hours BUT TO GO & CLOSE SO MANY TD BRANCHES DURING COVID19 IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!"
163,"Worst bank! They lie to you then lie to cover their lies. I was put on my Mothers account as she is getting older. I request no mail or emails from them as it is not my account and I do not want the paper. I Was told I would get no contact from them as it was my mother’s account. I get more mail from them then my own bank. The best was the letter I got advising that they had registered me with a government direct deposit for a pension. First, I don’t bank there. Second, I did not ask to have this done. Third, they claim that they did not register me.... the letter was very clear with my name and my name only on this letter. And finally, I do not qualify for seniors pensions. They keep sending me letters for credit cards.... again, I didn’t ask for this and I DO NOT BANK THERE!!! When asked to stop sending me there garbage, they told me they would not as I was a customer. I AM NOT A CUSTOMER! Never use the TD Bank. They kill the environment with unwanted mail. They drive you crazy by forcing credit cards on you. They do not listen to people. They are the used car salesmen of the banking world."
164,The worst bank on the planet most of their branches are not even open the once that are opened you have to wait outside 2 hours til they call you in  I called on the phone  after 1 hour 10 minute on hold got a hold of someone which she  still couldnt  resolved my issue and she had not knowledge of banking so i got transferred to someone another 30 minutes to wait  this is crazy i am so sad that i even i have an account with this bank ...looks like they laid off their entire stuff ..........due to covid 19 other banks are well prepared and organized but not sure why TD is a mess...........
165,"I opened an account with TD Bank in July 2019 to use the self directed investing platform.  After opening the chequing account, so I could transfer money to my self directed accounts, I could not deposit money at the ATM.  I took me two weeks, attending the bank once and a couple of phone calls to get the issue fixed.  Six months later, I noticed that my chequing account had been closed.  Fair enough, I didn't have any money in it, but it would have been nice to get an email or notice that the account would be closed, with an option to keep it open.  Now, I am trying to update my personal information and keep getting a service interruption message.  I can't get through to anybody on the phone and I keep getting  a cookie cutter message when I send a secure message.  As much as I love the TD self directed platform, they will not take my money for me to invest...  It has been frustrating.  I would definitively not recommend them for day to day banking..."
166,"I opened a new account the day a $300 promotion was offered. I found out later I should have been told about it. It took me 2 months of back and forth to receive the money. Another time I asked for money to be transferred into my new account from another bank. That was 2 months ago and still waiting. And try calling the main phone lines, you can wait anywhere from an hour to 2 hours to get through and then they cant answer your questions or give you the wrong info. This has happened over 10 times and I only opened my account 3 months ago."
167,"I've been a TD Canada Trust customer since 1980 and no complain before that. But when this pandemic arise I got charged a service fee of my checking account although my daily balance is $20K. I called the customer service and they said they sent me a notification (which I never received) to change my checking account to another checking account which they will re-imbursed the service fee unless I maintain a balance of $3K (doesn't make any sense), with free up to 25 transactions and $1.25 charged after your limit. I guess they does that because they know that we don't pay cash nowadays and more safe for us to use the debit card. GREAT"
168,Back office has a reason for not release funds . Two weeks now . 10 hours waiting on the phone.Come on people you will create a crisis with your lack of professionalism and tight fisted controls.
169,"Terrible bank! Period. I could write a book at this point! Most recently the story goes like this: My debit card expired and they emailed to say they were sending a new one. Never came. I called customer service and they sent out a replacement. Never came. I did this TWO MORE TIMES and STILL NO CARD. That's 4 tries at sending me a new client card and I still do not have one! My local branch is closed, indefinitely, due to Covid19. AND I DO NOT HAVE A CLIENT CARD THAT WORKS!!! So, in the middle of a pandemic I cannot access my bank account. If you call customer service it is an hour+ wait, every time, and I've already tried this route 4 times. If I try to go to the branch I cannot -- closed! BOTH Astoria branches closed. Not even a few hours a week. All their clients here are now stranded. THIS IS NOT LEGENDARY SERVICE. This is NOT America's most convenient bank. This is a terrible bank. Period. Now, don't even get me started with all the other poor experiences I've had in the past. I have a feeling this bank will, ultimately, fail and go under. Just too terrible."
170,I have been with TD bank my whole life and they have been great until recently I was fraud by someone and they made me pay back all the money without relief even though I am an unemployed student with debts. They shut down my account so that I am unable to do any sort of online banking and that I must go into a branch to do any sort of transfer or deposit. But when I went to make transfers they told me I had to call or use the app (both things I am unable to do with the state of my account) and I am now left with no money during a pandemic. And have no way to pay others or myself. I am livid and this bank should be shut down from such terrible service to a client who has been loyal and never involved in situations like this before. It just seems like everyone I talked to was willing to do the bare minimum to help me.
171,Td bank says most convenient or some dumb thing like that. This is the worst bank I've ever had. First they cancel a card I had. Then they restrict me from logging into my td app. And then say they can't do anything.  I'm beyond mad
172,"TD Bank. Can't even speak to human being using their ridiculous Easyline *during a pandemic* to change personal information on file so I can access Easyweb, and after having to listen to 5 minutes of covid and social distancing nonsense from a pre-recorded message I follow 4-5 more prompts to get told by the same automated message that I can just use Easyweb to change personal information, then it automatically hangs up on me!!! and obviously I can't use Easyweb because I have a new phone number which they use to send username/password reset codes to and when you ask for help on easyweb, guess what they tell you? That you can just use Easyline for getting help changing personal information. Ugh...Social distancing, ya right, this bank does not take it seriously or they'd be making damn sure we can speak to a human being over the phone. Even individual branches go straight to Easyline. Jesus Christ! Nothing easy about this. Guess I'll go social distance myself right into a branch since that's how they clearly prefer it."
173,"Where is  the 14.5 million people in Ontario emergency plan in understanding how our citizens of Canada ,Ontario  need to use DEBIT CARD due to Covid 19? We should not pay for transactions because it's cutting from the  low income people who need every cent as possible? And banks will be Robbing from everyone's pocket if there is no covid plan to help us !"
174,"Terrible customer service. Didn't offer a clear explanation of what would happen when canceling their insurance policy. When asked about the unknown charge after the cancelation, not only did they not offer an apology for the unclear explanation but also talked to customer in a condescending manner. So glad that I canceled the policy with TD."
175,"I was on the hold for an hour and half and after one and half an hour wait time they said they couldn’t take my call , that is Ridiculous. I couldn’t believe that nonsense."
176,"I just spent a total of 7 hours over the past two days to get my online access straightened out.  Bounced to 4 different CSR's with an average wait time of 45 minutes, only to be out back in queue each time.  Final transfer to tech support resolved nothing.  Moving to another bank.  TD is useless!"
177,I called to cancel a check from going through on 04/30/20 and was on hold for about 30 minutes. The representative wasn’t friendly either. I received a notification of my request except the check amount that I wanted to cancel was incorrect. Now I’m calling a second time and I have been on hold for an hour now. Horrible service!
178,They made me wait an hour and a half with their stupid queue app. And cancelled my queue as i got to number 10 and closed the door in my face. They created this situation and made life miserable for their customers by cutting down their opening hours. I'm pulling everything i own from this ridiculously disrespectful place...
179,I understand during Covid 19 it’s harder then normal to deal with needs as is! But given that my fiancé went to deposit money into the machine as to protect the workers so not going in since I am a first responder and the bank machine ate his money and his card it’s been over one week now and no phone lines are taking his call! How are we supposed to do banking with no card??? After calling about 10 times he was able to get ahold of one very rude lady who asked a few questions and then stated she could not verify him even after he told her the last bill he payed and to whom! And to call back??? Whaaat??? Very disgusting!!! Unprofessional and I believe he should switch banks! They refused him opening an investigation into his own account! Was it to much work for her? And then she hung up!!!
180,This organization is the worst in the business. They never resource the services desk and claim its due to the technology they can't transfer the calls. WHAT SHI when they have technology that deals with Billions of our dollars and seem to quite wellI know im not sharing anything most would not be familiar with but someone has to do something about these peopleThere should be a portal which is scanned by the Media and has all the complaints about the organization such as theseToday again in trading i lost 4k because the Platform is down and we can't get through to the traders.
181,"Why is the top management not doing anything ? when other organizations have struggled and dealt with,  TD  and other financial and investment companies don't seem like they are trying to solve the issues, making people not being accessible to their funds so they lock the money? especially during times like this, when more people call for  customer service,? I'm getting so frustrated with not being able to access to my fund when I need it most. have tried to call them for last few days just freaking unlock my access card (which is not even blocked due to my fault, the branch people don't even know why, there might be fraud transaction or whatever), have waited in line almost 6 hours everyday for last 5 days, few time cut offby itself,  what do I do? FUc I have been with TD  for 10years, as soon as I get through this I will dump them."
182,Very Unhappy with the service on a regular basis. Reduced staffing during covid 19 doesn't work for real life situations when you can not call to have an issue resolved and there are endless technical difficulties. I can not even be approved for overdraft protection when paying $15 p/mo. For the last 7 years. Time to take my money elsewhere. Use at own risk 💀
183,Can t reach easy web by phone can t transfert my money on the web.Terrible bank i Will have To go in the branch during a pandemic.Not impressed.
184,On various occasions TD bank services were inadequate card replacement due to fraudThey made it seem like I was guilty Cheque getting jammed in the banking machine Numerous phone calls and a month waitArrogant unprofessional operator For mortgage relief It should be called  TDH bankThe bank of TOM DERICK & HARRY
185,"I have been trying to get through the call queue at TD Investing for weeks.  Even before covid19 wait times were almost an hour.  Now I wait on hold for 90+ minutes and then the call terminates ""your call cannot be connected as dialled"".  I am 91 years old and trying to cash in my RRIF and I don't have time to spend the rest of my life on hold with TD.  Shame on you, TD."
186,"i have phoned telephone banking at TD for 15 days in a row. you get the covid-19 warning, short staffed, and each time I was on hold 36-76 minutes. This is the last time I will ever deal with this bank after 30 years. Meadowlark TD has been closed for weeks. Yet CIBC and RBC have both answered the phones.I think TD will lose a lot of clients over this. This really sucks for seniors. absolutely disgusting."
187,"I needed a bank draft for urgent matter. I went to TD bank on Kingsway in Vancouver. They gave me a link to sign up and wait in que. My number was 19. They asked me to go home and come when I am closer to 1. I was like fair enough, my house is close by.I come home and I get a text saying my number is 7. I am like whoa. I got to run. I ran and on the way, the number was like 3 in que and I clicked on need more time option cos my phone kept buzzing. Suddenly they said its cancelled and the bank is closed. I go and request the lady to help me cos I ran there and left as soon as I got the text. She told me to come on Monday. I told her I need to courier the bank draft as soon as possible for a very important task. She was like you are not going to mail over the weekend so just come on Monday. I tried to explain that I can get all my documents ready and mail them first thing in the morning because it will get delayed. She did not understand and kept on insisting that I go back home cos I was late. How am I supposed to know? You text me when my number is at 7 and not at 15 or 10. I ran all the way. I was not like asking them to let me in without being on the que. I couldn't go in the morning because I have to be at work.I explained her why I need the draft in detail. Now I have to take time off of work and go back on Monday. The system needs to send messages sooner. Like how did the number go from 19 to 7? Did you guys take in 12 people at once? The bank did not look big enough to help 12 people at once with social distancing.You should not tell people to go home in that case. It's not like you're doing this for the first day. You have been doing it for a while and you would know how long it may take. I was late because you asked me to go home. I was going to just wait there otherwise."
188,My card was blocked without letting me know now i cant use it for grocery ive been calling td since 12noon its been 4 hrs now. This is soo ridiculousI understand that it is pandemic time right now but they should have a better plan to help a customer.
189,"Due to ovid 19 I Waited outside standing in line almost an hour, when my turn came, I entered my ID with my TD card, I asked for a draft cheque she asked for ID, I indicated it's in my car one minute and will be back.  The manager denied me and said rudely loudly, come back when you are ready.  I indicated it is important for my mortgage and must have it today.  She said, no you can come back tomorrow.  She would not take me when they were closing within 20 min.  I ended up with late payment and would not help me.  I will take all my services out to another bank and will tell people about their inconsiderate and awfully service.  30 years with them and this is not acceptable.  Along with me my 4 sons will be taking their biz some where else.  Location was on 126 st. And146 ave. On April 23."
190,Td online banking isvdown 50% of the times i use it for yrs finding a new bank never had this problem with scotia bank ever
191,"TD Trust is the WORST bank in Canada. I have dealings with a few different banks and although customer service is slow during Covid-19, with the other banks (such as Tangerine), they still get back to you within 24 hours. With TD it has literally been FOUR WEEKS for them not getting back to me. And I’m still waiting! I have tried to get hold of an actual person every day for four weeks by every conceivable means they offer (easyline messaging, their ridiculous phone line which just hangs up on you, their Facebook page, and calling a branch to ask them to get back to me). Nothing. All I’ve gotten back are automated messages telling me to call the 800 number, the useless number that hangs up on me. We have a mortgage with them and the term is almost up, thus we need to renew. You would think they’d be interested in getting our service back. Apparently not. We will be going with a new bank. (The other banks offer better rates anyway but even if they didn’t I would NEVER deal with TD again.) I actually am wondering if they even are still in operation. How is it they can turn billion-dollar profits year after year and not hire more people to answer phones?"
192,"I would think during this pandemic banks like TD would have some compassion but there just money hungry and conning every single client out there. Before this pandemic, I was offered a promotion for a credit card balance transfer and in the written letter the instructions was simply to go online and do a transfer. Well that was done but a month or two passed and the interest on my statement was not adding up. Therefore I phoned customer service and supposedly a cash advance was drawn and they will not honour my previous promotion leaving me with hundreds of dollars of interest. Worst bank ever giving in this circumstance. Will be moving my bank, home insurance and car insurance elsewhere once this pandemic is over that’s for sure."
193,TD Bank Telephone service during Corona time is worse than any other Bank or service that I called.
194,My daughter deposited a GOVERNMENT CHEQUE that was meant to help with the pandemic.  They proceeded to hold that cheque for 6 days.  When she called to get help they did absolutely nothing to help her.  After reading all the reviews and seeing firsthand how they treat their customers I wouldn’t bank with them. Absolutely disgusting and shameful how they treated her during a goddamn pandemic. Special place in hell for bankers
195,wow thought Td actually cared about its customers now you try to call during a pandemic and they put you in hold and then hang up at least just tell us straight you won't be answering call and not waiste people's timehorrible experience
